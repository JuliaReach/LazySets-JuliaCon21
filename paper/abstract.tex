LazySets.jl is a Julia library that provides ways to symbolically represent sets of points as geometric shapes, with a special focus on convex sets and polyhedral approximations. LazySets provides methods to apply common set operations, convert between different set representations, and efficiently compute with sets in high dimensions using specialized algorithms based on the set types.

LazySets is the core library of JuliaReach, a cutting-edge software addressing the fundamental problem of reachability analysis: computing the set of states that are reachable by a dynamical system from all initial states and for all admissible inputs and parameters.
%
While the library was originally designed for reachability and formal verification, its scope goes beyond such topics.
%
LazySets is an easy-to-use, general-purpose and scalable library for computations that mix symbolics and numerics.

In this article we showcase the basic functionality, highlighting some of the key design choices.
